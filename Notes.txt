1> Setting up Raspi

	1.1> Setup the raspi and establish ssh with a host system
	1.2> Password for raspi's : user 
	1.3> To find the IP of raspi ( it is not static and might have changed when connected to a different network)

2> Setting up Quorvo modules

	2.1> Make sure the pins are in contact 
	2.2>The Power led and other indicators might be functioning but the SPI / UART pins can be not in contact 
	2.3> Hence make sure all the pins are in proper contact and use a header if possible 
	2.4> All the modules are flashed with the proper firmare
	2.5> Blinking led lights indicate the Module is actively looking for connectins

3> Communication between Raspi and Quorvo

	3.1> Use SPI (Had some trouble with UART and didnt manage to establish a comm. via UART)
	3.2>Make sure to check the connection type in Makefile 

4> Setting up the anchors

	4.1> Use the anc_cfg to init and configure the anchors 
	4.2> Initiator position ( 0 , 0 ,0 )
	2.2> Required parameters : Initializor = 1 / 0 and the position of the anchor with respect to initiator 

5> Code Development

	5.1> Visual Studio preferres
	5.2> Use remote explorer to connect with raspi. 
	5.3> This setup is useful because debugging can be done on host machine while compilation on raspi
	5.4> arm-linux-...-gcc toolchain as default in dwm_1001 Makefile
	5.5> Change it to arm....-g++ in case of C++ compilation is required


6> TCP Broadcast of data 

	6.1> One way communication (Client - Raspi , Server - Hand Console)
	6.2> Client pushes the data to TCP socket, no received acknowledment message needed from Server
